This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over arrays. The bug.java file shows the erroneous code that causes an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.  The bugSolution.java file provides a corrected version.  The error occurs due to an incorrect loop condition, which causes the loop to run one iteration too many. This is a frequent source of bugs in array manipulation and other iterative processes. Understanding how to avoid off-by-one errors is essential for writing robust and reliable code.
